## Database-like Program

This is a project I made for my third semester.

It is about creating a database using file systems and linked list in C. It doesn't work flawlessly, but it does its job correctly.
It's a database for students and lectures, just like a university's Student Information System (not that complex tho).
You can add students and lectures, remove them, register a student to a lecture or remove it.

You can view used files on this directory. (they are in Turkish)

I will add some of the meanings of the files.
- dersler -> lectures
- ogrenciler -> students
- OgrenciDersKayit -> StudentLectureRegistration
- kayitli -> registered
- sildi/birakti -> removed
- ders kapandi -> lecture closed
