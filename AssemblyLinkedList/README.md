## Linked List Implementation on Assembly

This was a homework for our Assembly Lecture.

It implements a linked list data type in assembly using arrays.
As you enter new elements, number and address arrays are updating. As a result, there is a linked list which is in ascending order.

I wrote a C code first without using any structs. Then converted it to assembly codes. I added the C code as well.
